## Week 11 Reflection

**Key Takeaways:**
- The capstone project is designed to reflect personal growth and real-world application.
- Clear milestones are set across Weeks 12â€“17 to guide feature development.
- We are expected to use tools like GitHub, APIs, and Tkinter in a practical way.
- Office hours and Slack are recommended support channels.
- Final submission includes a functional app and a demonstration.

**Concept Connections:**
- Strongest: API integration, Tkinter GUI design, SQLite3 database handling.
- Need more practice: Error handling, unit testing, packaging for deployment.

**Early Challenges:**
- Securing and loading the OpenWeatherMap API key safely.
- Setting up a clean project folder structure.
- Deciding on scalable features that reflect both creativity and feasibility.

**Support Strategies:**
- Attend Friday afternoon office hours for UI-related feedback.
- Ask questions in Slack #capstone-support for edge case handling.
- Use GitHub issues and milestones for project tracking.
