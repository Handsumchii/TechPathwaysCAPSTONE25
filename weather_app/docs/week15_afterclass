So far, all core features of the app are functional, including user login, real-time weather lookup, journal entry with mood tracking, and saving entries to a CSV file. The custom enhancement—weather and mood visualization charts—is partially working: charts are being generated and displayed within the UI, but they currently show sample data instead of actual journal data. The main blocker is ensuring the weather_journal.csv file is consistently updated and properly read by the charting function. My plan is to debug the CSV read process and test with real user entries to ensure charts reflect accurate, live data. I need help getting the charts to display real weather and mood data from the saved journal entries instead of the sample data.
