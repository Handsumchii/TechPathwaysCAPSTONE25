   To implement the API call, I used the requests library to connect to the OpenWeatherMap API, sending a request with the user's inputted city and retrieving the current weather data in JSON format. I parsed the response to extract useful information such as temperature, humidity, weather description, and wind speed, and then displayed this data in a Tkinter GUI. One challenge I faced was ensuring accurate temperature conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit, which I addressed by adding a toggle function. Another issue involved handling invalid city names or missing data, which I solved by adding try/except error handling and clear user messages. The next steps include enhancing the user interface and adding more advanced visualizations like multi-day forecasts.
