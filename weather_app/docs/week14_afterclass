My custom feature is a weather and mood data visualization dashboard that generates four interactive charts based on journal entries saved by the user. It works by reading from the weather_journal.csv file, analyzing the recorded moods, temperatures, and timestamps, and then displaying visual insights such as mood trends over time and average temperature by mood. The charts are embedded directly into the appâ€™s UI using Matplotlib and Tkinter. A known bug is that if the CSV file is missing or has formatting issues (e.g., empty rows or incorrect headers), the charts may not load properly. The next step is to add a refresh button so the dashboard updates automatically whenever a new journal entry is saved.
